- "It has been an absolute pleasure to work alongside Saad in Geeks Select. When he joined the office, he seemed to be a very straight forward guy and we had an interaction after a few days.

He has also made our OZPOS project a running success and we are now working in different cities of Australia through his great flutter development skills.He is a genuine and well reputed person and one of the best people I had in my professional life. I wanted to write more about him but I guess I need help in typing more. 😄😄😄"  [**Hammad Abbasi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hammad-abbasi09/)
